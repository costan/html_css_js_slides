h1. HTML, CSS and JavaScript Slides

This is the source code for a slide deck used in a 4-hour course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The deck only renders correctly in Google Chrome (and possibly Safari). Firefox will work once it supports SVG images in the @<img>@ tag.

h2. Build Instructions

h3. Prerequisites

You will need Ruby, Rake and the <code>codex</code> Ruby gem to build this deck.

h3. Building the Deck

Issue the following command in the presentation's root directory. The presentation's entry point is <code>html/all.html</code>.

<pre><code>
rake all
</code></pre>

h2. Contributions

All errata is welcome, especially in the form of patches.

h3. Codex and S5

The deck is built using Dave Thomas' "codex":http://github.com/pragdave/codex/ slide compile, which in turn uses Eric Meyer's "S5":http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ slideshow renderer.

The best introduction to codex is the default slide deck generated by its "codex" command.
